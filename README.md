# Portfolio

Knowing I'll have to make a portfolio in my training 2nd year, but also to show the world my talents(hehe ðŸ˜¼), I started (with much haste) to develop my personnal portfolio !<br/>

This was the occasion for me to try learning and mastering some new skills : React, NPM, Vite and Git ! (By the way, this is my first time using Git/GitHub)
I started installing Node.js, that can be used to install frameworks to easify my work. These frameworks are then imported in the project to work !
With Node.js I installed the "Vite" tool, used to have a local server to display the project.
But I tried once to develop this project with the help of Copilot, it was ineffective because I actually haven't got the actual minimum knowledge about React ;-;<br/>
I went to CodÃ©dex, a website where you can get a bunch of courses to learn to code, I finished the free React lessons, then I officially started coding THIS actual portfolio ! hurray ^^<br>

I started with the bases of my portfolio, using React router to be able to navigate between the different pages without refreshing.
Then I made two components for the moment:<br>
<ul>
  <li>"Nuage" (french for "Cloud") with is used to get to a specified page or go back to the homepage</li>
  <li>"ContactForm" put in the Contact page, using the "EmailJS" framework to allow any interested client to send me a mail directly via the portfolio !</li>
</ul>
